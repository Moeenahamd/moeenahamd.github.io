This recent [Cronless](https://cronless.com/) update brings the following improvements to the log pages of cron jobs:

- Both free and premium members can now view all the logs without any restrictions.
- The export feature (available to premium members) now exports up to 100,000 records.
- The export feature (available to premium members) now exports to JSON file format.

Please note that to keep the website and the back-end server responsive and manageable we only keep log records that are less than a year old. So all the log records, whether listed on the page or exported, will be limited to that period of time.
