We did some minor interface and settings tweaks this week to [Cronless](https://cronless.com/):

- Minimized the Server Load's refresh counter to 15 seconds to display a more accurate number.
- Reformatted the jobs and monitors log pages to easily read and analyze.
- Moved the notification settings from Settings to its own page.
- And last but not least, added a Date and Time Format setting to the Settings page.
