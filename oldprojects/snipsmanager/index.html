To install SnipsManager: Extract the downloaded file in a folder in your computer. Log in to your web hosting account using an FTP client like Filezilla and upload the contents of the folder. Log in to your web hosting account’s control panel and create a MySQL database. Run the installer by opening the install.php page in the root folder, and enter the details of the database you created. Delete the install.php and upgrade.php files in the root folder using your FTP client. Now SnipsManager should be working without any problems. If you need to change the database details after deleting the file install.php read the next section. How can I change the database connection details? If you changed the database name, username, password or installation location and would like to change the settings in SnipsManager to reflect that you’ll find these details in the config.php page. You will not be able to view or modify the contents of the file if you open it in a web browser; you’ll have to edit the file using your control panel’s text editor or download it and make the changes locally on your computer then upload it to your website. The contents of the file are: &amp;lt;?php $sitename = &#39;http://localhost/snipsmanager/&#39;; function connect() { mysql_connect(&amp;lt;DB_Location&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;DB_User&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;DB_Password&amp;gt;); mysql_select_db(&amp;lt;DB_Name&amp;gt;); } ?&amp;gt; The contact page is not working? For the contact page to work you will need to enter your name and email address in the last two fields in the General tab of the Settings page in the Admin area. If you would prefer to hide the contact page you can remove it from the top menu by editing the Interface Settings page. How can I display banner ads at the bottom of pages? You can modify the design to add banners where you see fit, but if you do not want to mess with HTML and CSS you can display a banner at the bottom of every page by editing the footer.php page and pasting the code immediately after the: &amp;lt;!– Advertising –&amp;gt; line. The ideal size for banners in this location is 468 pixels by 60 pixels. How can I remove index.php from the homepage URL? To hide index.php from the homepage URL, i.e. redirect http://example.com/index.php to http://example.com/ open the file .htaccess in the root folder with a text editor. Its contents should be: RewriteEngine On #shortens URLs from /show.php?id=123 to /123 RewriteRule ^([0-9].*) show.php?id=$1 [L] #uncomment and modify domain to redirect www.example.com to example.com #RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.example.com [NC] #RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 [L,R=301] #uncomment and modify domain to redirect /index.php to / #RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,9}\ /(([^/]+/)*)index\.php\ HTTP/ #RewriteRule index\.php$ http://example.com/%1 [R=301,L] Then: Replace the domain example.com in line 12 with the domain name SnipsManager is installed on. Remove the hash sign ‘#’ at the beginning of line 12. Save and close .htaccess. How can I disable URL Shortening? As of version 2.3 SnipsManager has URL shortening enabled by default. So snippet URLs will be http://example.com/123 instead of http://example.com/show.php?id=123. If you would like to disable it: Open the file parser.php located in the includes folder with a text editor. Replace line 65 with the following line: $link = $sitename . &quot;show.php?id=&quot; . $row[&#39;id&#39;]; Replace line 68 with the following line: //$link = $sitename . $row[&#39;id&#39;]; Save and close includes/parser.php. Open the file .htaccess in the root folder with a text editor. Replace line 4 with the following line: #RewriteRule ^([0-9].*) show.php?id=$1 [L] Save and close .htacces."><meta name="google-site-verification" content="Vk0IOJ2jwG_qEoG7fuEXYqv0m2rLa8P778Fi_GrsgEQ"><meta name="msvalidate.01" content="0FB4C028ABCF07C908C54386ABD2D97F" ><link rel="canonical" href="https://moeenahamd.github.io/oldprojects/snipsmanager/"><meta property="og:title" content="SnipsManager"><meta property="og:description" content="SnipsManager is a free and open source PHP script for creating websites to share source code and plain text like emails, poems and articles with others.
